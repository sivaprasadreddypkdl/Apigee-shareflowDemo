# Getting Started

Often the most difficult and confusing aspect of application development is figuring out how to build a common framework for creating new applications. Over time, development teams have started using tools like Maven, Ant and Ivy to automate some of these functions. This plugin uses the Maven plugin for deploying Apigee bundles to the Edge platform.

#### Why this deployment plugin is developed?

- Helps in offline development.
- Easy integrations with source control like git.
- The Maven build strategy is a good strategy if your current enterprise build and deploy strategies already use Maven or Maven compatible tools.
- Configuration management across organizations/environments.
(Realtime Enterprise Edge architecture consists of multiple organizations/environments and configurations which varies according to these. An example scenario for this use would be the Maven configuration file to replace the number of requests it takes to trip a spike arrest policy. In your non-production environment you may want this policy to take effect when 10 requests a minute is surpassed, in production you may want this policy to trip when 10000 requests a minute is surpassed.)



## Building API bundles

### What is an Apigee bundle?

Apigee bundles can be described as a zipped file system composed of configuration, scripts and code. The file system when extracted is composed of the following structure.

```
 |-apiproxy/
   |-proxies
   |-resources
   |-policies
   |-targets
```

### Create a new API

Instructions for creating a new API can be found at this link

[http://apigee.com/docs/api-platform/content/add-and-configure-your-first-api](http://apigee.com/docs/api-platform/content/add-and-configure-your-first-api)

### Export your API

Instructions for exporting your API via an API can be found at this link

[http://apigee.com/docs/api/api\_methods/105-export-an-api](http://apigee.com/docs/api/api_methods/105-export-an-api)

To export you API via Apigee Edge select the organization that contains the proxy you wish to export. From the navigation bar on the top, under APIs select the API Proxies. Select the proxy, on the far left of the screen, under the drop down menu titled Project, select Download Current Revision.

## Steps to set it up

Follow below steps to set up your local development environment

1. Create the folder structure as described in the  section
2. Create and configure pom files - Parent pom and the child pom for the proxy
3. Create and configure config.json - if there are environment specific configurations (This is an optional step)

And you are ready for deploy to Apigee Edge using the plugin

### Step 1 Create a Maven compatible file structure


Below is the recommended structure for the project. However only the folder structure below the folder gateway is mandatory

```
  |-name-of-root (typically company name)
    |-archive/
      |-docs
      |-src
    |-binaries/
    |-build-artifacts/
    |-docs/
      |-customer
      |-reference
      |-solution
    |-src/
      |-analytics
      |-gateway/ ***
        |-parent-pom
        |-test-app/
          |-apiproxy/
            |-proxies
            |-resources/
              |-py
            |-policies
            |-targets
      |-java
      |-portal
    |-test
```

#### Decompress API Bundle

The API bundle will come zipped, use the unarchiving utility of your choice to unzip the file.

Once unzipped you will have a folder named apiproxy, this folder contains all of the configuration for your proxy and the folder structure needed for re-importing of the configuration.

The composition of the folder can be described as below.

File/Folder | Purpose
---- | ----
{ApiName}.xml | A file that contains descriptors for the content
policies/ | A folder that contains all policy xml files
proxies/ | A folder that contains information about your proxy configurations (inbound)
targets/ | A folder that contains information about target configurations (outbound)
resources | A folder that contains any scripts (java, jsc, py, node)

Note: when creating scripts, place your script/jar files in the proper folders based on the script type (e.g. javascript in jsc, node.js in node, java in java).



### Step 2 Create and configure pom files

In a standard configuration typically we have parent-pom (pom.xml inside the *parent-pom* directory) and a child pom (pom file at  the peer level as folder *apiproxy*).

The contents of the parent pom folder will contain a single pom.xml file. This file typically contains most of the configuration of Maven and the plugin, it also contains credentials for the Apigee platform.

In case of manual creation of Maven compatible file structure, "parent-pom" directory should be in peer level with other application folders. Here we configure information that is common across multiple apiproxys. Eg: Profile configurations which has the org/env info etc.

#### parent-pom-pom-xml Sample

Refer parent-pom template [parent-pom](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-deploy-maven-plugin/blob/master/samples/mockapi-recommended/src/gateway/shared-pom.xml)

 * **groupId** element's content should be set to client's company name.  Here you see it as apigee.
 * **artifactId** element's content be left as parent-pom.

Child-pom: Here we configure all the details specific to the particular proxy.

#### pom-xml Sample

Refer child-pom template [child-pom](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-deploy-maven-plugin/blob/master/samples/mockapi-recommended/src/gateway/Mock-v1/pom.xml).

 * **groupId** element's content should match that of the same element in the parent pom.xml.
 * **artifactId** element's content should be a unique name, typically set to the name of the API.
 * **name** element's content should match the artifactId above (typically set to the name of the API).
 * **side-note** groupId and artifactId, combined, define the artifact living quarters within a repository.

### Step 3 Create and configure config.json

The config.json contains rules to perform build time configuration update. This JSON file's root object is  "configurations" and is an array of proxy or sharedflow configurations scoped to an environment. 

Note: it is important that the name of the configurations match the name of the profiles in the parent-pom.

For instance in the example below you have two configurations one for the test profile and one for the production profile. This example also shows how you can use xpath to replace environment specific settings.

#### Config.json Sample

Refer config.json template [config.json](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-deploy-maven-plugin/blob/master/samples/mockapi-recommended/src/gateway/Mock-v1/config.json)

## Commands for deploying the proxy using maven

*To deploy the proxy*

```
/src/gateway/proxy-dir
(run the command from the directory same as child pom)

mvn apigee-enterprise:deploy -P<profile> -Dusername=<username> -Dpassword=<password>
```

For example:

```mvn apigee-enterprise:deploy -P prod -Dusername=admin@toopowerful.com -Dpassword=too\_powerful\_password```

*To deploy the proxy and run jmeter tests*

```mvn install -P  <profile_name> -Dusername=<username> -Dpassword=<password>```

## Advanced Configuration Options

##### Note 1
The following entries in some XML file elements could be changed to match the customer's environment: 
* "groupId"
* "id" (for each profile sections)
* "apigee.profile"
* "apigee.env"
* "apigee.hosturl"
* "apigee.org"

1. The contents of "apigee.profile", "apigee.env", and "id" elements should match the profile the customer wants to use and is matched with environment name. 
2. The value of the "apigee.hosturl" element should match the value in the example if the customer is an enterprise cloud user. 
    * If the customer is an private cloud user, this url would be the location of the customer's management server host and port. The port is 8080 by default. 
3. The value of the "apigee.org" element should match the organization provided when Customer environment was initially setup, in most cases this includes the name of the company. 
   * For private cloud installations, the org is setup when you run installation scripts. The Maven group id is malleable and is also marked in red for both pom examples, the only thing to note when changing this is that they need to be consistent between applications.

#### Note 2
The"apigee.override.delay", "apigee.delay,apigee.options" are optional elements. The "apigee.delay" could be specified (in milliseconds). This will ensure to add a delay between the operations like delete, import, activate, deactivate etc.

#### Note 3
The "apigee.options" element can have the following values: **clean** (this option will delete the last deployed revision in an environment), **validate** (this option will validate a bundle before importing. Thus if you want strict validation then its required), **inactive** (this option will import the bundle without activating the bundle), **override** (this option is used for seamless deployment and should be supplied with apigee.override.delay parameter. The apigee.override.delay expects delay to be given in seconds), **update** (this option will update the revision). This is similar to import with validation but no new revision is created. If there are any errors in the bundle, an error is thrown and the existing bundle is left intact. In case the revision they are trying to update is deployed, it will internally trigger undeployment and deployment. It is completely in the background and not visible in the response.

#### Note 4
The "apigee.options" combination could be given with comma separated values. The precedence order of options are -> override, update, (clean, inactive, validate).

## To configure a proxy 
Supported from v1.2

Please refer to this [doc](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html) that explains how to setup proxy settings in your settings.xml usually in your $HOME/.m2 directory. Only `https` protocol is supported

## OAuth and Two-Factor Authentication
Apigee management APIs are secured using OAuth tokens as an alternative to the Basic Auth security. Additionally Two-Factor authentication (MFA) using TOTP can also be configured as an additional layer of security. This plugin has the capability to acquire OAuth tokens and invoke management API calls.

Refer to [How to get OAuth2 tokens](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/using-oauth2-security-apigee-edge-management-api#howtogetoauth2tokens) and [Two-Factor authentication](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/enable-two-factor-auth-your-apigee-account)for details.

### Using OAuth
OAuth capability when enabled is seamless and the plugin acquires OAuth tokens and uses it subsequently to call management APIs. 

To enable OAuth add the following options to all profiles as required. Refer to [shared-pom.xml](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-deploy-maven-plugin/blob/master/samples/mockapi-recommended/src/gateway/shared-pom.xml) example.

    <apigee.tokenurl>${tokenurl}</apigee.tokenurl> <!-- optional: oauth -->
    <apigee.authtype>${authtype}</apigee.authtype> <!-- optional: oauth|basic(default) -->

To invoke, add command line flags to enable OAuth.

    mvn install -Ptest -Dusername=$ae_username -Dpassword=$ae_password \
                        -Dorg=testmyapi -Dauthtype=oauth

"tokenurl" is optional and defaults to the cloud version "https://login.apigee.com/oauth/token"

### Two-Factor Authentication
[Two-Factor authentication](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/enable-two-factor-auth-your-apigee-account) is based on TOTP tokens. When the apigee account is enabled for Two-Factor Authentication it applies to management APIs as well.

The plugin can accept TOTP tokens generated by an external utility and use it to acquire OAuth tokens.

TOTP can be generated using command line tools for use in CI tools like Jenkins.

### Using Two-Factor Authentication token
**Note** OAuth needs to be enabled before Two-Factor Authentication can be used. 

To enable Two-Factor Authentication, add the following options to all profiles as required. Refer to [shared-pom.xml](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-deploy-maven-plugin/blob/master/samples/mockapi-recommended/src/gateway/shared-pom.xml
) example.

    <apigee.mfatoken>${mfatoken}</apigee.mfatoken> <!-- optional: mfa -->

Provide the token when invoking the plugin.

    mvn install -Ptest -Dusername=$ae_username -Dpassword=$ae_password \
                        -Dorg=testmyapi -Dauthtype=oauth -Dmfatoken=123456
                        
If the API takes a long time to package up then  it is likely that the token till have expired before it is used.  To mitigate against this, from version 1.1.3, an initmfa goal can be called during the validate phase:

    <execution>
        <id>initialise-mfa</id>
        <phase>validate</phase>
        <goals>
            <goal>initmfa</goal>
        </goals>
    </execution>

Depending on where the plugin is in the order, and how much validation is requird, it is possible that this may still result in token timeout.

### Passing the Bearer Token as a parameter
If you would like to generate the bearer token outside of this plugin and provide it as a command line parameter, you can add the following: 

    <apigee.bearer>${bearer}</apigee.bearer>

Provide the token when invoking the plugin.

    mvn install -Ptest -Dusername=$ae_username -Dorg=testmyapi \
                         -Dauthtype=oauth -Dbearer=c912eu1201c
                        
### Passing the Refresh Token as a parameter
If you would like to generate the refresh token outside of this plugin and provide it as a command line parameter, you can add the following: 

    <apigee.refresh>${refresh}</apigee.refresh>

Provide the token when invoking the plugin.

    mvn install -Ptest -Dusername=$ae_username -Dorg=testmyapi \
                         -Dauthtype=oauth -Dbearer=c912eu1201c -Drefresh=d023fv2312d
                        
  
*NOTE: If you are providing refresh token, you need to provide the bearer token as well*

## Deploying API Proxies with Node.js apps

Starting at version 1.0.1 of the plugin, support for API proxies that contain node.js applications is included.  The plugin 
will compress the ```node_modules``` directory contained in ```apiproxy/resources/node```.  

The plugin also supports moving node.js application source into ```apiproxy/resources/node``` if the source exists
outside of the API proxy structure itself.  An example structure when node.js application source is beside ```apiproxy```:

```
    |-name-of-root (typically proxy name)
      |-apiproxy
        |-proxies
        |-resources
          |-node (where root/node gets moved to)
        |-targets
      |-node (where node.js application source exists)
```
 
 Note: In above example, if you have code in ```node/``` and ```apiproxy/resources/node```, the source in ```node/``` takes 
 precedence and any files located in ```apiproxy/resource/node``` will be overwritten.

The above structure follows the same pattern when developing with java source code outside of the ```apiproxy``` bundle working directory.

## Building Shared Flow bundles

### What is a Shared Flow bundle?

Shared Flow bundles can be described as a zipped file system composed of policies, steps and code. The file system when extracted is composed of the following structure.

```
	 |-sharedflowbundle/
	   |-policies
	   |-sharedflows
```
The build steps and the options available for building and deploying Shared Flows are the same as API Proxy. Most widely used options are ```override``` and ```update```
The [samples](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-deploy-maven-plugin/tree/master/samples/security-sharedflow/src/sharedflows) has an example of a standard sharedflow with the folder structure and the parent pom file. The only key difference between the API Proxy and the Shared Flow is a new property as part of the profiles.

`<apigee.apitype>sharedflow</apigee.apitype>`

This is required to differentiate the build and deployment process.
